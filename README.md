# M1 - Applied Math in Games: Minor Assessment (FA1.2.2)

A Unity 3D project demonstrating the use of **vectors**, **geometric transformations**, and **custom character design** through an interactive, physics-based scene.

## 🎮 Features
- 🧍 **Custom-built character** made from multiple primitive 3D shapes (not a prefab model)  
- 🧭 **Smooth first-person camera** that follows the player’s head and uses mouse look  
- 🏃 **Player movement** with **WASD** keys  
- 🦘 **Jumping** with the **Spacebar** (only when grounded)  
- 🏃‍♂️ **Sprinting** with **Left Shift** for faster movement  
- 🕵️ **Sneaking / Crouching** with **Left Control**, smoothly scales the player’s height  
- 🧱 **Obstacles and ramps** placed throughout the scene for testing movement and collisions  
- 🧮 Demonstrates scaling, rotation, and positional vector transformations in action  

## 🕹️ Controls
| Action | Key |
|--------|-----|
| Move   | **WASD** |
| Look   | **Mouse** |
| Jump   | **Spacebar** |
| Sprint | **Left Shift** |
| Crouch | **Left Control** |

## 🧱 Scene Elements
- Simple geometric environment (walls, ramps, and blocks)  
- Physics interactions using Rigidbody components  
- Proper collision, ground detection, and jump validation
